<h1>GW0742 vs S23 – My Experience, Results & What You Should Know</h1>

<p>If you're looking at <strong>GW0742</strong> and <strong>S23</strong>, chances are you're serious about cutting fat, building lean muscle, or both. I’ve run full cycles of each—GW0742 for endurance and fat loss, S23 for hard muscle and strength. Both are powerful but totally different animals.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll break down <strong>how they worked for me, what results I got, what side effects I noticed, and who should use which compound</strong>. And yes—I’ll give you legit sources at the end of each section (these are the exact ones I used).</p>

<h2>GW0742 – Like Cardarine But Stronger?</h2>

<p><strong>GW0742</strong> is a PPARδ receptor agonist, like Cardarine (GW501516), but with more selectivity for fat metabolism. I ran this at <strong>15mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a cut. I was curious if it could outperform GW501516 in terms of endurance and fat-burning—and it actually did.</p>

<h3>My Results on GW0742:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increased endurance on cardio and HIIT</li>
  <li>Visible fat loss after Week 2</li>
  <li>Could train longer without fatigue</li>
  <li>No crash or stim feeling—very smooth</li>
  <li>No testosterone suppression at all</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s like having a <strong>supercharged metabolism</strong>. I didn’t notice any muscle loss even while in a deficit. It also helped me recover faster between sets. Compared to Cardarine, GW0742 gave me <strong>better fat-burning and stamina</strong>—but without touching my hormones.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Excellent for cutting and endurance</li>
  <li>No hormonal suppression</li>
  <li>No liver toxicity at recommended dose</li>
  <li>Great for fasted cardio</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No muscle-building effect</li>
  <li>Not for bulking at all</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Cardio Performance, Recomp</p>

<h2>S23 – The Hardcore Muscle Builder</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is one of the most powerful SARMs out there. I ran it at <strong>10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a mini bulk. S23 is famous for being strong, dry, and suppressive. I went into this knowing it would hit hard—and it did.</p>

<h3>My Results on S23:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dense muscle gains within 2–3 weeks</li>
  <li>Increased strength across the board</li>
  <li>Zero water retention—looked dry and shredded</li>
  <li>Vascularity increased dramatically</li>
  <li>Test suppression kicked in around week 4</li>
</ul>

<p>S23 gave me that “<strong>3D muscle look</strong>”—the kind of hardness and detail I don’t even get on RAD140. It’s definitely not for beginners. It hit libido and test levels hard near the end, so I used a 4-week PCT afterward.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Insane muscle density and strength</li>
  <li>No bloating or water weight</li>
  <li>Perfect for cutting or hard bulking</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Highly suppressive</li>
  <li>Needs a PCT</li>
  <li>Can affect sleep or aggression in higher doses</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Recomp, Advanced Users</p>

<h2>GW0742 vs S23 – Which Should You Use?</h2>

<p>These two compounds couldn’t be more different. Here’s a quick comparison based on my real-world use:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Compound</th>
      <th>Best Use</th>
      <th>Muscle Gain</th>
      <th>Fat Loss</th>
      <th>Suppression</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>GW0742</strong></td>
      <td>Cutting / Endurance</td>
      <td>❌ None</td>
      <td>✅ High</td>
      <td>❌ None</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>S23</strong></td>
      <td>Cutting / Lean Bulk</td>
      <td>✅ Very High</td>
      <td>✅ Moderate</td>
      <td>✅ High</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If your main goal is to <strong>cut fat, boost cardio, or do fasted training</strong>, GW0742 is the clear winner. If you want <strong>dry muscle gains and can handle suppression</strong>, S23 is unmatched.</p>

<h2>How I Tested These SARMs</h2>

<p>I always test SARMs solo—no stacking—so I can see exactly what each one does. My testing protocol includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed calorie intake and training split</li>
  <li>Tracking lifts, body weight, vascularity</li>
  <li>Weekly pics and strength logs</li>
  <li>Pre- and post-cycle bloodwork</li>
</ul>

<p>I also monitor recovery, sleep quality, libido, and mood. These details matter when you’re evaluating side effects, not just gains.</p>

<h2>FAQs – GW0742 vs S23</h2>

<h3>Can I take GW0742 and S23 together?</h3>
<p>You can, but I wouldn't recommend it for first-time users. Run each solo first so you know how your body reacts.</p>

<h3>Does GW0742 affect testosterone?</h3>
<p>No. It’s not hormonal and won’t suppress natural testosterone production.</p>

<h3>Do I need a PCT for S23?</h3>
<p>Yes. S23 is very suppressive. You’ll want at least 4 weeks of Nolvadex or Clomid after a full cycle.</p>

<h3>Is GW0742 better than Cardarine?</h3>
<p>In my experience, yes. It gave me better endurance and more noticeable fat loss with zero side effects.</p>

<h3>Can beginners use S23?</h3>
<p>No. It's very strong and not beginner-friendly. Start with something lighter like Ostarine or AC262,536 first.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>GW0742 and S23 serve totally different goals</strong>. If you're focused on endurance, fat loss, or want something non-suppressive, go with <strong>GW0742</strong>. If you're experienced and want extreme strength and dry gains, <strong>S23</strong> delivers—but it comes with suppression and side effects.</p>

<p>Always cycle smart, monitor your health, and get bloodwork done. I only recommend what I’ve used and verified.</p>
